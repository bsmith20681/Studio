# Studio 

Studio is a responsive one page website demonstrating my HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap skills. I was able to get the design through XD guru, a website for free Adobe XD templates. I then sliced the images and coded the interface using HTML, SASS, and Bootstrap. 

## Getting Started

Simply download the files and run them in your favorite web browser!

### Prerequisites

If you plan on changing any of the SASS code, then you will want to have a compiler ready. I recommend using Koala if you have never used a SASS compiler before. 

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-End Framework
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
